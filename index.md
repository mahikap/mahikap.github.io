Hi! I'm **Mahika Phutane**, a PhD candidate at Cornell.

</div>
I'm advised by [Prof. Aditya Vashistha](https://www.adityavashistha.com/), and I study how artificial intelligence (AI) serves, represents, and supports people with disabilities.

As these technologies shift from mere tools to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù assistive technologies, there is a concern that **these technologies may perpetuate disability bias and promote ableist behaviors** and sentiments. I use a mixture of quantitative, qualitative, and design research methods to identify these emerging concerns. Through my work, I work closely with marginalized populations and advocate for equitable disability representation in emerging AI systems.

My research spans the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, and Natural Language Processing. I am generously funded by the [Dennis Washington Foundation](https://www.dpwfoundation.org/scholarships/dennis-washington-leadership-graduate-scholarship/), and hold ongoing collaborations with Microsoft Research India, and the NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office of People with Disabilities.
