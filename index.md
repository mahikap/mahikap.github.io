Hi! I'm **Mahika Phutane**, a PhD student at Cornell University. 

</div>


I'm advised by **[Shiri Azenkot](http://shiriazenkot.com/)** at the Enhancing Ability Lab, where I explore the following questions:
  - How can we better understand, design, and deploy **systems for accessibility**? 
  - What are the **social and technical complexities** surrounding assistive technologies?

I wish to study the nuanced relationship between people with disabilities and technology, a relationship that grows in significance with emerging AI-backed systems.
