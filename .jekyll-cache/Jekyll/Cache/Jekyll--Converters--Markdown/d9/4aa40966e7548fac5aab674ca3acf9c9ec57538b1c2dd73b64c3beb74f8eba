  <p>Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Mahika Phutane</strong>, a PhD student at Cornell University.</p>

</div>

<p>Iâ€™m ever grateful to be advised by <strong><a href="http://shiriazenkot.com/">Shiri Azenkot</a></strong> at the Enhancing Ability Lab, where I explore the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can we better understand, design, and deploy <strong>systems for accessibility</strong>?</li>
  <li>What are the <strong>social and technical complexities</strong> surrounding assistive technologies?</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish to study the nuanced relationship between people with disabilities and technology, a relationship that grows in significance with emerging AI-backed systems.
